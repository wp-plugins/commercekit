WordPress e-commerce made simple

== Description ==

CommerceKit is a simple e-commerce plugin that allows to sell products using the Stripe payment processor.

Aimed at people that want to setup a simple shop in a few minutes, its main value proposition is to make is as simple as possible for you to sell using WordPress, respecting the key values of the WordPress philosophy:

1) Out of the Box: CommerceKit works without even a minimal setup. Install and point your browser to yoursite.com/?ck_product=test. You'll be immediately able to complete a (test) order.

2) Design for the Majority: add your products, set up the tax and shipping rates, sell!

3) Decisions, not Options: minimal setup options let you focus on selling, not setting up the shop.

4) Striving for Simplicity: really, it's as simple as it can be.

CommerceKit tries to blend nicely with any theme you might be using, but of course it's impossible to guarantee. If you find the interface is weird, just email us.
